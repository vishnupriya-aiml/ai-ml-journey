# Sentiment Classification using BERT (Transformers)

This project implements a modern NLP classifier using a pre-trained 
BERT model (via HuggingFace Transformers) fine-tuned for binary 
sentiment analysis (positive/negative).

The project follows a full engineering pipeline:
- data loading
- BERT tokenization
- fine-tuning using TensorFlow/Keras
- model saving
- evaluation with classification report + confusion matrix

This README will be expanded after the training and evaluation steps.
