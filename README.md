# Vishnu Priya – AI/ML Engineering Portfolio

Welcome to my AI/ML engineering portfolio.  
This repository is a collection of real end-to-end projects focused on:

- clean coding
- structured workflows
- practical ML/NLP problem-solving
- building models that can be deployed and used in real applications

All projects include complete pipelines — data, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and where relevant, small apps.

# ⭐ Featured ML/NLP Projects

Below are structured, industry-style ML projects with clear organization and reproducible pipelines.

---

## 1️⃣ Fake News Detection (NLP + Streamlit App)  
**Path:** `02_ML/fake_news_detection`  

A complete NLP pipeline that classifies news headlines as **REAL** or **FAKE**, with a Streamlit web application.

**Highlights**
- TF-IDF with unigrams + bigrams  
- Logistic Regression classifier  
- Evaluation: confusion matrix + classification report  
- Reusable prediction helper (`predict_text`)  
- Streamlit app (`app/app.py`) to test predictions interactively  
- Clean modular structure: preprocessing, training, evaluation, prediction modules

---

## 2️⃣ Sentiment Analysis (NLP)  
**Path:** `02_ML/sentiment_analysis`  

Binary sentiment classifier for short reviews.

**Highlights**
- Text cleaning and normalization  
- Bag-of-Words features with CountVectorizer  
- Logistic Regression model  
- Train/test split, evaluation metrics, saved model  
- Organized project layout (src, models, reports)

---

## 3️⃣ Student Performance Prediction (Tabular ML)  
**Path:** `02_ML/student_performance_prediction`  

Predicts whether a student passes based on multiple subject scores and engineered features.

**Highlights**
- Data cleaning & feature engineering  
- Logistic Regression classifier  
- EDA visualizations  
- Train/test split + evaluation  
- Saved model + reports
