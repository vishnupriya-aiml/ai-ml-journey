# Sentiment Analysis – Text Classification (ML Project)

A machine learning project to classify text (sentences) into sentiment labels  
(e.g., positive vs negative). This is a core type of problem in NLP and is used in:
- product reviews
- customer feedback analysis
- social media monitoring
- chatbot understanding

## 🎯 Project Goals
- Build a clean, modular sentiment analysis pipeline.
- Use classical ML (e.g., Logistic Regression, SVM) on text features.
- Later, extend to more advanced models (e.g., TF-IDF, possibly transformers).

## 🗂 Project Structure
- `data/` – raw and processed text datasets.
- `notebooks/` – EDA, text cleaning, experiments.
- `src/` – Python modules for preprocessing, training, evaluation.
- `models/` – saved trained models.
- `reports/` – metrics, project structure, documentation.
- `requirements.txt` – dependencies list.

More details coming as the project evolves.
